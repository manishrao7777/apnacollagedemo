introduction

“Rama is in the grain of pleasure”

The one who resides in every particle, that is Ram. There are many stories of Shri Ram in Sanatan Dharma. The unique stories of Shri Ram's life, Maharishi Valmiki has presented it in a very beautiful way in Ramayana. Apart from this, Goswami Tulsidas composed Ramcharitmanas and took Shri Ram to the heart of the people.

sri ram navami

“On the ninth day of Chaitra.

In the five constellations of the goddess Aditi in their highest positions

with the point of speech in Cancer in the planets.”


This verse mentioned in Valmiki's Ramayana is about the birth of Lord Rama. Shri Ram was born in Treta Yuga. His birthday is celebrated on the ninth day of Chaitra month.

Prabhu Shri Ram was born in Ayodhya, present-day Uttar Pradesh. He was the eldest son of King Dasharatha of Ayodhya. King Dasharatha had three queens – Kaushalya, Kaikeyi and the youngest Sumitra. King Dasharatha got sons after a lot of chanting and penance. Four sons were born from his three queens. The eldest queen was Rama from Kaushalya, Bharata from Kaikeyi and Lakshmana and Shatrughna from Sumitra.

childhood

From childhood, Shri Ram was very kind and modest, and was closest to his father. Or rather, he was the weakness of King Dasharatha. King Dasharatha did not want to take him away from his sight even for a moment. Even after being a stepmother, he used to give affection and respect to Kaikeyi the most. For him all his three mothers were equal. Being the eldest, he took great care of all his younger brothers.

Education Graduation

Shri Ram's education-initiation was completed in the ashram of Guru Vashistha. Lord Ram was very mighty since childhood. He had started the sequence of his might from his childhood. Later on he killed many demons and most important, killed the mighty Lankapati Ravana and made this earth pure.s					</p>
